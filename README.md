# qcml-credit-risk-analysis
Project submission for IITD-QCML on Credit Risk Analysis

## Problem Statement
The idea of the project is to examine the credit risk of a portfolio holding certain number of assets. The credit risk is measured by finding the difference between Value at Risk and the expected value oa given loss distribution. This measurements will give us an summary of the amount of capital that is required to remain Solvent with a given confidence score. 

We provide estimates of the total number of required qubits, the expected circuit depth,
and how this translates into an expected runtime under reasonable assumptions on future faulttolerant quantum hardware. 

### We will be using Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate risk measures with a quadratic speed-up over classical Monte Carlo simulation.
